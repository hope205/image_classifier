# image_classifier

Hello guyz

I made this project using the google machine learning image labelling kit for this app. This app is capable of telling you the name of an object based on the image it is given.

You have options to choose the images through your gallery or using camera.

Make sure you connect your app to you firebase account , download the required json configuration file and include it in your project folder.

Hve fun trying it out
